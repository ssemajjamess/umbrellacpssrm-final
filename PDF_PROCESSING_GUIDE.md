# PDF Processing System Guide

## ðŸŽ‰ Automated PDF Contract Processing

Your CRM now has **full automated PDF processing** that can read signed contracts from your customer portal, extract customer information, create customer records, and save the PDF to the document management system.

## How It Works

### 1. PDF Upload
- Upload a signed PDF contract from your customer portal
- The system automatically extracts text from all pages
- Uses advanced pattern matching to find customer information

### 2. Information Extraction
The system extracts the following information from PDFs:
- **Customer Name** - Looks for patterns like "Customer:", "Name:", "Client:", "Insured"
- **Phone Number** - Multiple formats supported (555-123-4567, (555) 123-4567, etc.)
- **Email Address** - Standard email format detection
- **Address** - Full address with street, city, state, zip
- **Insurance Company** - Matches against known insurance companies
- **Claim Number** - Various claim number formats
- **Policy Number** - Policy number detection
- **Roof Type** - Asphalt, metal, tile, slate, wood
- **Replacement Type** - Full, partial, repair
- **Adjuster Information** - Adjuster name and contact details

### 3. Customer Creation
- Automatically creates a new customer record
- Sets stage to "LEAD"
- Marks as "PDF Import" source
- Sets claim filed status to "YES"

### 4. Document Management
- Saves the PDF to the customer's document folder
- Organizes by customer name and timestamp
- Links document to customer record
- Maintains file integrity

- Pattern matching results
- Customer creation process

## Best Practices

### PDF Preparation
1. **Use text-based PDFs** when possible
2. **Ensure clear formatting** for better extraction
3. **Include all required fields** in consistent format
